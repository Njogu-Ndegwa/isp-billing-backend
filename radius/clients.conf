# FreeRADIUS Clients Configuration
# =================================
# This file defines which NAS (Network Access Servers) can communicate with RADIUS.
# Each MikroTik router that uses RADIUS authentication needs an entry here.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file is dynamically generated by the ISP Billing system.
# Manual changes may be overwritten. Use the API to add/remove RADIUS clients.
#
# For testing, we include a default client that accepts connections from any IP
# in the Docker network. In production, you should restrict this.

# Default client for Docker network (internal)
client docker_network {
    ipaddr = 172.16.0.0/12
    secret = testing123
    shortname = docker_internal
    nas_type = other
}

# Allow localhost for testing
client localhost {
    ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
    secret = testing123
    shortname = localhost
    nas_type = other
}

# Example MikroTik router entry (replace with your actual router IP)
# client mikrotik_router_1 {
#     ipaddr = 10.0.0.1
#     secret = your_shared_secret_here
#     shortname = router1
#     nas_type = mikrotik
#     # Optional: Require Message-Authenticator for enhanced security
#     require_message_authenticator = no
# }
